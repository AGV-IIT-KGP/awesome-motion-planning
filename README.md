Awesome Motion Planning
=======================

An attempt to collect a curated list of awesome learning resources, research
papers, tools and other resources related to Biology. This is inpired from
several such lists in programming community.

If you want to contribute to this list (please do), [send a pull
request](https://github.com/AGV-IIT-KGP/awesome-motion-planning/compare/),
[open an
issue](https://github.com/AGV-IIT-KGP/awesome-motion-planning/issues/new) When
sending suggestions please add a short blurb/description about each book that
you have personally read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings,
etc.  irrespective of any particular field or subject area.

All the resources need not be freely available for download.
